## Hello World

Hi. I'm [Nitin](https://www.nameshouts.com/libs/media/nitin_hi.mp3). I am a Software Engineer living in Texas. 

## Little about me ðŸ˜‰
I currently work as a Senior Software Engineer at Redfin in the Redfin Mortgage Org. In my last 1+ yeat at Redfin Mortgage engineering, I helped a growing team build one of the biggest integration projects that our team has built in recent years while actively helping in hiring, onboarding, and mentoring the new hires on the team. The appraisal management integration helped improve the productivity of the customer by more than 80%. Additionally, I have been involved in improving the front-end coding standards at Redfin by advocating the use of newer technology & libraries. Some of the projects I worked on at Redfin have been mentioned in the press releases that go out to Redfin shareholders. 

Before Redfin, I worked at Text-em-all LLC (Formerly Call-Em-All LLC) mainly focused on the front-end (ReactJS, Redux, NodeJS). At Text-em-all, I routinely contributed as a full-stack engineer on API & cloud projects. I also managed the Machine Learning projects that we use to power our texting platform. I helped start and organize Frisco CoderDojo and a popular Meetup group in Dallas - ReactJSDallas when I was an intern at Text-em-all in 2016 - while I was actively contributing as a front-end developer on the product team and contributing to Material-UI as one of its core collaborators.

Before moving to the US for grad school, I worked as a Systems Engineer at Tata Consultancy Services where I was responsible for the design & implementation of several enterprise applications, task estimation, peer code reviews, testing, and bug fixes. I was also the go-to guy for UI design and development on my team & have designed, developed, and revamped over 300+ web pages.

Bluebox Global Pte Ltd., was where my professional career started. At Bluebox, I was the single point of contact for all the IT needs of the business.

I have 6+ years of experience in the field of enterprise application design, and development and worked on projects involving a myriad of technologies and tech stacks. I feel my biggest asset is understanding the needs and pain points of business and using technology solutions to alleviate the gaps in processes and improve the efficiency of the customer.

I got my Masterâ€™s degree in Computer Science from Northeastern University, Boston in 2017 & Bachelors' in Information Technology from Mumbai University. I like to run, rock-climbing, ride my bike, travel, and click amazing pictures.

Specialties: ReactJS, Javascript, ES6, Redux, Next.js, Java, HTML5, CSS3,  OOP, Spring MVC, UX & UI Design, Responsive Web Design, Web Development, Human-Computer Interaction.

During normal (pre-pandemic) times, I mentor kids at [Frisco CoderDojo](https://dojo.call-em-all.com/#/Home).
